Studies of unsupervised learning algorithms exploring R available functions/packages. A project that was born in Data mining I course from NOVA Masters in Advanced Analytics.

# Status
Soon I'll make the theory review report available and update the shiny application built (waiting for professor's grade, so I can change things there).

The code on this repository is the Shiny App code in its newer version.

The current *course* versoin is hosted in my account on [Shinny Applications Server](https://karina-rebuli.shinyapps.io/clusteringShiny/).
